# Front Vue Apps

## Code Style

- Always use this template syntax for new Vue 3 + TS components

  ```vue
  <script lang="ts" setup>
  /*
   * Custom Types
   */
  type Props = {
    // props here
  };

  /*
   * Vue Definitions
   */
  defineProps<Props>();
  </script>

  <template>
    <div class="parent">
      <div class="parent__children"></div>
    </div>
  </template>

  <script lang="scss" scoped>
  .parent {
    /* CSS Rules here */

    &__children {
        /* CSS Rules here */
    }
  }
  </script>
  ```

  - Don't add comments with `//`, never.
  - Always use `function name() {}` over `const name = () => {}`
  
## Code recommendations  

- Always check folders to verify if have a model, function or other resource with same functionality, to avoid duplications
- If possible, on helper functions, hooks, stores, etc, add JSDocs (but, without @return declaration) with only a description and a use example.

## Chat results

- Don't send a changes resume, I don't care about, and I don't read that.
- Be straight to the point, do what I asked without inventing and without breaking what already exists.
